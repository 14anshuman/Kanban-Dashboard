## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories, `frontend` and `backend`, to maintain a clean separation of concerns.

```

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A running MongoDB instance (either local or from a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create an environment file**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables.

    ```env
    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

    # A strong, secret string for signing JWTs
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

    # The port for the server to run on
    PORT=5001
    ```

4.  **Build and Run**:
    - **For development (with hot-reloading)**:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - **For production**:
      First, build the TypeScript code:
      ```bash
      npm run build
      ```
      Then, start the server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is designed to be served by a static file server. The dependencies like React and Axios are managed via an **importmap** in `frontend/index.html`, so no `npm install` is required for the frontend.

Simply open the `frontend/index.html` file in a browser, or serve the `frontend` directory using a local web server. The application is configured to make API calls to `/api`, so it expects the backend to be accessible on the same origin (a proxy is recommended in a real-world deployment).

### Running Backend Tests

To run the integration tests for the backend API:

1.  Ensure you are in the `backend` directory.
2.  Make sure your `.env` file is configured correctly for a test database if needed.
3.  Run the test command:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
